==> Total network power (routers and global clock tree) = 20964.897 (uW) = 20.965 (mW)
Total network energy per packet = 534895.684 (pJ/packet) = 53489.568 (pJ/flit)
--- energy of all routers per packet  = 492329.791 (pJ/packet) = 49232.979 (pJ/flit)
--- global clock tree energy per packet = 42565.893 (pJ/packet) = 4256.589 (pJ/flit)
