Total power of all routers = 298263.051 (uW)
Global clock tree power + PLL (don't count subtrees inside routers) = 1775.148 (uW)
==> Total network power (routers and global clock tree) = 300038.199 (uW) = 300.038 (mW)
Total network energy per packet = 4493672.104 (pJ/packet) = 449367.210 (pJ/flit)
--- energy of all routers per packet  = 4467085.714 (pJ/packet) = 446708.571 (pJ/flit)
--- global clock tree energy per packet = 26586.391 (pJ/packet) = 2658.639 (pJ/flit)
==========================================
Average router energy per packet (including global clock) = 17553.407 (pJ/packet/router) = 1755.341 (pJ/flit/router)
