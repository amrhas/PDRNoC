Global clock tree power + PLL (don't count subtrees inside routers) = 2242.130 (uW)
==> Total network power (routers and global clock tree) = 402475.530 (uW) = 402.476 (mW)
Total network energy per packet = 4236054.952 (pJ/packet) = 423605.495 (pJ/flit)
--- energy of all routers per packet  = 4212456.532 (pJ/packet) = 421245.653 (pJ/flit)
--- global clock tree energy per packet = 23598.420 (pJ/packet) = 2359.842 (pJ/flit)
==========================================
Average router energy per packet (including global clock) = 13074.244 (pJ/packet/router) = 1307.424 (pJ/flit/router)
