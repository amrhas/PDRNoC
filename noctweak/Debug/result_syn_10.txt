Total network energy per packet = 813.285 (pJ/packet) = 81.329 (pJ/flit)
--- energy of all routers per packet  = 804.413 (pJ/packet) = 80.441 (pJ/flit)
--- global clock tree energy per packet = 8.872 (pJ/packet) = 0.887 (pJ/flit)
==========================================
Average router energy per packet (including global clock) = 8.133 (pJ/packet/router) = 0.813 (pJ/flit/router)
