==> Total network power (routers and global clock tree) = 54220.893 (uW) = 54.221 (mW)
Total network energy per packet = 1168747.306 (pJ/packet) = 116874.731 (pJ/flit)
--- energy of all routers per packet  = 1143032.733 (pJ/packet) = 114303.273 (pJ/flit)
--- global clock tree energy per packet = 25714.573 (pJ/packet) = 2571.457 (pJ/flit)
==========================================
Average router energy per packet (including global clock) = 9659.069 (pJ/packet/router) = 965.907 (pJ/flit/router)
