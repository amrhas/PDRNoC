===================== CONFIGURATIONS ===================== 
./noctweak -platform synthetic -reconfig_time1 10 -reconfig_time2 20 -dimx 2 -dimy 1 -fir 0.8 -routing xy -vcd waveform -sim 20000 -router vc 
==================== SIMULATION DONE! ====================
=================== PERFORMANCE RESULTS ==================
Average network latency = 60.747 (cycles) = 0.061 (us) = 60.747 (ns)
Average network throughput = 0.002 (packets/cycle) = 0.011 (flits/cycle) = 10.886 (flits/us) = 0.011 (flits/ns)
------------------------------------------------------
Total number of received packets after warmup = 87
Simulation stop at cycle = 20000th
