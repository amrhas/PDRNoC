Inactive router power (average power at fir of 0 = router leakage + local router clock) = 148.973 (uW)
==========================================
Total power of all routers = 387173.762 (uW)
Global clock tree power + PLL (don't count subtrees inside routers) = 2242.130 (uW)
==> Total network power (routers and global clock tree) = 389415.892 (uW) = 389.416 (mW)
Total network energy per packet = 9729945.488 (pJ/packet) = 972994.549 (pJ/flit)
--- energy of all routers per packet  = 9673923.624 (pJ/packet) = 967392.362 (pJ/flit)
--- global clock tree energy per packet = 56021.865 (pJ/packet) = 5602.186 (pJ/flit)
==========================================
Average router energy per packet (including global clock) = 30030.696 (pJ/packet/router) = 3003.070 (pJ/flit/router)
