Total network energy per packet = 1545707.555 (pJ/packet) = 154570.756 (pJ/flit)
--- energy of all routers per packet  = 1530285.851 (pJ/packet) = 153028.585 (pJ/flit)
--- global clock tree energy per packet = 15421.704 (pJ/packet) = 1542.170 (pJ/flit)
==========================================
Average router energy per packet (including global clock) = 9146.199 (pJ/packet/router) = 914.620 (pJ/flit/router)
