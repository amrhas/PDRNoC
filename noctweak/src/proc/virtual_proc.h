 *
 *  Define of a virtual core with only I/O ports and virtual functions without implemented
 *  All cores have to inherit this virtual core and to implement these virtual functions
 *
 *  Revised:
 *  	+ Oct 25, 2010: now support virtual-channel router
 *  	+ Nov 18, 2010: support credit-based flow control
